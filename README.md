## Installation

Tested with RubyInstaller with dev-kit v2.6.9-1 for Windows [(download)](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-2.6.9-1/rubyinstaller-devkit-2.6.9-1-x64.exe).

Install bundler by running:

```
>> gem install jekyll bundler
```

## Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.
